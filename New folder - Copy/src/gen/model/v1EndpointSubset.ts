/**
* EndpointSubset is a group of addresses with a common set of ports. The expanded set of endpoints is the Cartesian product of Addresses x Ports. For example, given:   {     Addresses: [{\"ip\": \"10.10.1.1\"}, {\"ip\": \"10.10.2.2\"}],     Ports:     [{\"name\": \"a\", \"port\": 8675}, {\"name\": \"b\", \"port\": 309}]   } The resulting set of endpoints can be viewed as:     a: [ 10.10.1.1:8675, 10.10.2.2:8675 ],     b: [ 10.10.1.1:309, 10.10.2.2:309 ]
