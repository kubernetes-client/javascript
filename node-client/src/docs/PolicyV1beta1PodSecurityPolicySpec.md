**allowedCapabilities** | **[String]** | AllowedCapabilities is a list of capabilities that can be requested to add to the container. Capabilities in this field may be added at the pod author&#39;s discretion. You must not list a capability in both AllowedCapabilities and RequiredDropCapabilities. | [optional] 
**allowedFlexVolumes** | [**[PolicyV1beta1AllowedFlexVolume]**](PolicyV1beta1AllowedFlexVolume.md) | AllowedFlexVolumes is a whitelist of allowed Flexvolumes.
