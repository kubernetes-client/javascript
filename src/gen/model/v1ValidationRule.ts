    /**
    * Rule represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL. ref: https://github.com/google/cel-spec The Rule is scoped to the location of the x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema. The `self` variable in the CEL expression is bound to the scoped value. Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource: {\"rule\": \"self.status.actual <= self.spec.maxDesired\"}  If the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value. Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {\"rule\": \"self.components[\'Widget\'].priority < 10\"} - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {\"rule\": \"self.values.all(value, value >= 0 && value < 100)\"} - Rule scoped to a string value: {\"rule\": \"self.startsWith(\'kube\')\"}  The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and from any x-kubernetes-embedded-resource annotated objects. No other metadata properties are accessible.  Unknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property schema is of an \"unknown type\". An \"unknown type\" is recursively defined as:   - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true   - An array where the items schema is of an \"unknown type\"   - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an \"unknown type\"  Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - \'__\' escapes to \'__underscores__\' - \'.\' escapes to \'__dot__\' - \'-\' escapes to \'__dash__\' - \'/\' escapes to \'__slash__\' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to \'__{keyword}__\'. The keywords are:    \"true\", \"false\", \"null\", \"in\", \"as\", \"break\", \"const\", \"continue\", \"else\", \"for\", \"function\", \"if\",    \"import\", \"let\", \"loop\", \"package\", \"namespace\", \"return\". Examples:   - Rule accessing a property named \"namespace\": {\"rule\": \"self.__namespace__ > 0\"}   - Rule accessing a property named \"x-prop\": {\"rule\": \"self.x__dash__prop > 0\"}   - Rule accessing a property named \"redact__d\": {\"rule\": \"self.redact__underscores__d > 0\"}  Equality on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type of \'set\' or \'map\' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:   - \'set\': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and     non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.   - \'map\': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values     are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with     non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.
