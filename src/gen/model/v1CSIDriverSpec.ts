If set to false, pod information will not be passed on mount. Default is false.  The CSI driver specifies podInfoOnMount as part of driver deployment. If true, Kubelet will pass pod information as VolumeContext in the CSI NodePublishVolume() calls. The CSI driver is responsible for parsing and validating the information passed in as VolumeContext.  The following VolumeContext will be passed if podInfoOnMount is set to true. This list might grow, but the prefix will be used. \"csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.name\": pod.Name \"csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.namespace\": pod.Namespace \"csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.uid\": string(pod.UID) \"csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral\": \"true\" if the volume is an ephemeral inline volume                                 defined by a CSIVolumeSource, otherwise \"false\"  \"csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral\" is a new feature in Kubernetes 1.16. It is only required for drivers which support both the \"Persistent\" and \"Ephemeral\" VolumeLifecycleMode. Other drivers can leave pod info disabled and/or ignore this field. As Kubernetes 1.15 doesn\'t support this field, drivers can only support one mode when deployed on such a cluster and the deployment determines which mode that is, for example via a command line parameter of the driver.  This field was immutable in Kubernetes < 1.29 and now is mutable.

This is typical for storage backends that provide volumes as filesystems on block devices or as independent shared volumes. Kubernetes will call NodeStage / NodePublish with \"-o context=xyz\" mount option when mounting a ReadWriteOncePod volume used in Pod that has explicitly set SELinux context. In the future, it may be expanded to other volume AccessModes. In any case, Kubernetes will ensure that the volume is mounted only with a single SELinux context.  When \"false\", Kubernetes won\'t pass any special SELinux mount options to the driver. This is typical for volumes that represent subdirectories of a bigger shared filesystem.  Default is \"false\".

In this mode, volumes are defined inline inside the pod spec with CSIVolumeSource and their lifecycle is tied to the lifecycle of that pod. A driver has to be aware of this because it is only going to get a NodePublishVolume call for such a volume.  For more information about implementing this mode, see https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/ephemeral-local-volumes.html A driver can support one or more of these modes and more modes may be added in the future.
