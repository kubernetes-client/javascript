The name of the ResourceClaim will be <pod name>-<resource name>, where <resource name> is the PodResourceClaim.Name. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a ResourceClaim (e.g. too long).  An existing ResourceClaim with that name that is not owned by the pod will not be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated resource by mistake. Scheduling and pod startup are then blocked until the unrelated ResourceClaim is removed.  This field is immutable and no changes will be made to the corresponding ResourceClaim by the control plane after creating the ResourceClaim.
