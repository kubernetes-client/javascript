    /**
    * expression will be evaluated by CEL to create a [JSON patch](https://jsonpatch.com/). ref: https://github.com/google/cel-spec  expression must return an array of JSONPatch values.  For example, this CEL expression returns a JSON patch to conditionally modify a value:     [      JSONPatch{op: \"test\", path: \"/spec/example\", value: \"Red\"},      JSONPatch{op: \"replace\", path: \"/spec/example\", value: \"Green\"}    ]  To define an object for the patch value, use Object types. For example:     [      JSONPatch{        op: \"add\",        path: \"/spec/selector\",        value: Object.spec.selector{matchLabels: {\"environment\": \"test\"}}      }    ]  To use strings containing \'/\' and \'~\' as JSONPatch path keys, use \"jsonpatch.escapeKey\". For example:     [      JSONPatch{        op: \"add\",        path: \"/metadata/labels/\" + jsonpatch.escapeKey(\"example.com/environment\"),        value: \"test\"      },    ]  CEL expressions have access to the types needed to create JSON patches and objects:  - \'JSONPatch\' - CEL type of JSON Patch operations. JSONPatch has the fields \'op\', \'from\', \'path\' and \'value\'.   See [JSON patch](https://jsonpatch.com/) for more details. The \'value\' field may be set to any of: string,   integer, array, map or object.  If set, the \'path\' and \'from\' fields must be set to a   [JSON pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901/) string, where the \'jsonpatch.escapeKey()\' CEL   function may be used to escape path keys containing \'/\' and \'~\'. - \'Object\' - CEL type of the resource object. - \'Object.<fieldName>\' - CEL type of object field (such as \'Object.spec\') - \'Object.<fieldName1>.<fieldName2>...<fieldNameN>` - CEL type of nested field (such as \'Object.spec.containers\')  CEL expressions have access to the contents of the API request, organized into CEL variables as well as some other useful variables:  - \'object\' - The object from the incoming request. The value is null for DELETE requests. - \'oldObject\' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests. - \'request\' - Attributes of the API request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)). - \'params\' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind. - \'namespaceObject\' - The namespace object that the incoming object belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped resources. - \'variables\' - Map of composited variables, from its name to its lazily evaluated value.   For example, a variable named \'foo\' can be accessed as \'variables.foo\'. - \'authorizer\' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.   See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz - \'authorizer.requestResource\' - A CEL ResourceCheck constructed from the \'authorizer\' and configured with the   request resource.  CEL expressions have access to [Kubernetes CEL function libraries](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/#cel-options-language-features-and-libraries) as well as:  - \'jsonpatch.escapeKey\' - Performs JSONPatch key escaping. \'~\' and  \'/\' are escaped as \'~0\' and `~1\' respectively).  Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Required.
