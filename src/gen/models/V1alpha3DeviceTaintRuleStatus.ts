    * Conditions provide information about the state of the DeviceTaintRule and the cluster at some point in time, in a machine-readable and human-readable format.  The following condition is currently defined as part of this API, more may get added: - Type: EvictionInProgress - Status: True if there are currently pods which need to be evicted, False otherwise   (includes the effects which don\'t cause eviction). - Reason: not specified, may change - Message: includes information about number of pending pods and already evicted pods   in a human-readable format, updated periodically, may change  For `effect: None`, the condition above gets set once for each change to the spec, with the message containing information about what would happen if the effect was `NoExecute`. This feedback can be used to decide whether changing the effect to `NoExecute` will work as intended. It only gets set once to avoid having to constantly update the status.  Must have 8 or fewer entries.
