The generation may be reset by drivers, which should be fine for consumers, assuming that all ResourceSlices in a pool are updated to match or deleted.  Combined with ResourceSliceCount, this mechanism enables consumers to detect pools which are comprised of multiple ResourceSlices and are in an incomplete state.
