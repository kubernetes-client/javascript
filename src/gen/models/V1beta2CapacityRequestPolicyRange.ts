* CapacityRequestPolicyRange defines a valid range for consumable capacity values.    - If the requested amount is less than Min, it is rounded up to the Min value.   - If Step is set and the requested amount is between Min and Max but not aligned with Step,     it will be rounded up to the next value equal to Min + (n * Step).   - If Step is not set, the requested amount is used as-is if it falls within the range Min to Max (if set).   - If the requested or rounded amount exceeds Max (if set), the request does not satisfy the policy,     and the device cannot be allocated.
