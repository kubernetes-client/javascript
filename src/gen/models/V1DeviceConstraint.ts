This constraint is used to avoid allocating multiple requests to the same device by ensuring attribute-level differentiation.  This is useful for scenarios where resource requests must be fulfilled by separate physical devices. For example, a container requests two network interfaces that must be allocated from two different physical NICs.

A device which does not have that attribute will not be chosen. All devices should use a value of the same type for this attribute because that is part of its specification, but if one device doesn\'t, then it also will not be chosen.
