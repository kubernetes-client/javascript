The key in the map is the name of the pod and the value is the time when the API server processed the eviction request. If the deletion didn\'t occur and a pod is still there it will be removed from the list automatically by PodDisruptionBudget controller after some time. If everything goes smooth this map should be empty for the most of the time. Large number of entries in the map may indicate problems with pod deletions.
